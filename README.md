# Project Description : DIVVY Bikes Data Project

This application is designed to process and analyze data from the DIVVY bike-sharing system, focusing on two primary types of data: station information and records of bike trips taken by riders. Upon launching, the program first requests the user to input the filename containing the station data, followed by the filename for the bike trips data. These inputs are expected to be provided through the keyboard.

The application meticulously checks for the existence and accessibility of the files. In the event that either the stations file or the bike trips file cannot be opened, an error message will be displayed, specifying the problematic filename. This prompt action ensures that users are immediately aware of any issues in accessing the required data, allowing for a swift resolution. Following the verification process, the program proceeds to its analytical functionalities only if both files are successfully loaded.
