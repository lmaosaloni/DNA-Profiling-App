# DNA-Profiling-App

# Introduction
The DNA Profiling Application is a C++ program designed to help in the identification and analysis of individuals based on their DNA sequences. Utilizing Short Tandem Repeats (STRs), a method commonly used in forensic science, this application can match DNA sequences to individuals in a given database. Additionally, it features a unique command, relative_to, which calculates and displays the closest DNA relative to a specified individual within the database, showcasing the project's creative component.

# Getting Started
   # Dependencies
   C++ Compiler (GCC recommended)
   Make (Optional for compilation automation)
   Compilation

# To compile the DNA Profiling Application, follow these steps:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the source code.
Compile the program using the following command:  g++ -std=c++11 -o DNAProfiling main.cpp

# Running the Program

After compilation, you can run the program with the following command:
./DNAProfiling


# Development Setup
This application was developed and tested with GCC version X.XX, but it should be compatible with most C++11 standard compilers. No external libraries or frameworks are required.
